# csv-validation-tool

This is a python tool to validate CSV files based on regex statements.
The CSV file present in the repository is there for testing purposes. (this is not real persons data)
If you don't work with devcontainers, you can ignore/delete the **.devcontainer** repository.
To use the script, place your own CSV file in the root directory and change the **config.json** accordingly.
Once the **config.json** is configured to your liking, you can just execute **main.py** with the command `python main.py`.
