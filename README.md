# csv-correction-tool (work in progress, still in dev state)

This is supposed to become a python tool to validate and correct csv files based on regex statements.
The csv file present in the repository is there for testing purposes. (this is not real persons data)
If you don't work with devcontainers, you can ignore/delete the .devcontainer repository.
